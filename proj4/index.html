    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this assignment, I built features to comprise a cloth simulator. I
      began by building a cloth model consisting of a system of masses and
      springs, implementing springs which represented each type of constraint
      (structural, shearing, and bending.) I then used the Verlet intergration
      to simulate new point mass positions, allowing forces to be applied to our
      cloth model and produce movement between time steps. I added code to
      handle collisions with other objects by calculating points of intersection
      and adjusting the new position by a correction vector. To handle
      self-collisions, I used spatial hashing to look up the point masses within
      the system and apply a repulsive collision force to avoid self-collisions
      in the cloth. I then wrote a few basic GLSL shader programs to produce
      diffuse shading, Blinn-Phong shading, texture mapping, displacement
      mapping, bump mapping, and environment-mapped reflections.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reflecting on my implementation and process, I initially struggled to
      accurately implement the constraint for the cloth system such that the
      spring did not change in length more than 10% per timestep. This resulted
      in the cloth appearing to experience more acceleration than it was
      supposed to, slipping off the sphere very quickly, or eventually "flying"
      out of the field of view at zero damping. While I initially didn't
      understand the cause of these effects, I was able to resolve this through
      carefully inspecting the parts of code that I suspected could result in
      this behaviour, such as applying the external and external forces, and
      eventually landed on revising the spring constraint. I also spent some
      time trying to figure out an appropriate hash for the spatial mapping in
      Part 4; my initial hash caused the program to run extremely slowly, but
      after looking through some comments on the Project 4 hub on Ed, I was able
      to develop a more reasonable hash.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
    <p>
      I began by building a grid of masses and springs to model the cloth. This
      involved dividing the cloth into evenly spaced point masses, and
      connecting adjacent masses with springs. Next, I created springs to apply
      the constraints between point masses, representing the three types of
      constraints: structual, shearing, and bending. By setting up these
      vectors, I was able to set up a "mesh" which would dictate how the
      relationships between point masses should behave in the next part.

    <h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
    <p>
      After producing the system of masses and springs to represent the cloth
      model, I integrated the physical equations of motion to dictate how the
      cloth should move between time steps as forces are applied. I computed the
      total force acting on each point mass by combining the external forces
      (e.g. gravity) and the spring correction forces which apply the spring
      constraints to connect the cloth. I then used the Verlet intergration to
      calculate the new point mass positions such that
      <code
        >new_position = most recent position + (1.0 - damping factor) * (most
        recent position - second most recent position) + total acceleration from
        all forces * timestep^2</code
      >. If a point is pinned, its new position is not updated. I constrained
      position updates to prevent springs from being unreasonably deformed at
      each time step by limiting a spring's length to at most 10% greater than
      its rest length. I did this by calculating a correction vector and
      applying it situationally depending on whether both point masses were
      unpinned or if one of them was pinned.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      When the spring constant <code>ks</code> is varied, the cloth falls at
      different speeds and appears differently impacted by the "stiffness" of
      the springs, resulting in more stretching or ripples in the cloth. At a
      low <code>ks</code> of 500, the cloth falls faster and exhibits more
      ripples/wrinkles as the springs extend more, and the final resting state
      of the pinned cloth hangs with a lower "dip" in the cloth between the
      pins. At the default of 5000, the cloth falls slower than at 500, exhibits
      less ripples, and has a higher dip in the middle at its final resting
      state. At a higher <code>ks</code> of 50000, the cloth falls the slowest
      and appears smooth as it falls, appearing most "taut" in its resting
      state.

    <p>
      At a lower density, the cloth hangs with less folds in its resting state,
      giving the appearance of less weight, and also has less folds during its
      fall. The opposite can be said for a higher density, where the cloth hangs
      lower in its resting state and wrinkles more during its fall. However,
      from human observation, there is no significant change in the time the
      cloth takes to fall.

    <p>
      When damping is varied, the time the cloth takes to fall varies
      drastically. At zero damping, the cloth falls quickly and takes a long
      time to reach a rest state, instead swinging back and forth wildly and
      heavily impacted by forces. There are many wrinkles and folds in the cloth
      at zero damping, in particular making non-uniform shapes as it swings. At
      default damping, the cloth is able to reach a rest state immediately after
      falling, and falls slower. We can see that when damping is at 100%, the
      cloth appears very smooth while falling, and falls much slower. However,
      the ultimate rest state of all the cloths remains the same.

    <h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
    <p>
      I added support for cloth collision with spheres and planes by determining
      if a given point mass is inside the primitive, and if so, correcting the
      point mass's position to stay at a small distance outside the primitive's
      surface. For spheres, I computed where the intersection between the vector
      direction of the point mass's position and sphere's origin with the
      sphere's surface. After finding this intersection point, I used this to
      compute the correction vector and adjusted the new position, scaling by
      friction. For handling collisions with planes, I calculate where the point
      mass should've intersected the plane if it had travelled in a straight
      line from its position towards the plane. I use this to produce a
      correction vector, also using a small constant surface offset for the
      slight displacement above the plane, and scale down by friction.
    </p>

    <div class="col2">
      <div>
        <img src="./p3_a.png" width="95%" id="figure" />

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      We can see that with an increase in ks, the folds become stiffer and so
      fall over the sphere without following the shape of the sphere as much as
      the default ks. For a lower ks, there are more folds as the cloth drapes
      itself over the sphere and more closely follows the spherical shape. Since
      the spring constant is lower, the cloth appears more malleable in
      following the shape, but these deformations as it resembles the sphere
      result in more folds.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      To handle the cloth model's collision with itself and prevent it from
      clipping through, I looped through all pairs of point masses, calculate
      the distance between these pairs, and then add a correctional vector to
      the two point masses if they are more than 2 * distance apart. To make
      sure I didn't collide a point mass with itself, I checked as I looped
      through every point mass that the candidate point mass for the pair wasn't
      equal to the original. To build a spatial map of all point masses and
      allow for efficient comparison of point masses, I experimented with
      different hashes, eventually choosing
      <code
        >(x position - fmod(x position, w)) / w + (y position - fmod(y position,
        h)) / h * 0.5 + (z position - fmod(z position, t)) / t * 0.25</code
      >, where <code>w = width / num_width_points * 3</code>,
      <code>h = height / num_height_points * 3</code>, and
      <code>t = max(w, h)</code>.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      We can see that at a lower density the cloth falls with less and smoother
      folds, while I noticed that at a higher density during the entire fall the
      cloth's surface appeared very wrinkled, with more and smaller folds. At a
      smaller ks, the cloth had smaller folds and wrinkles closer to where the
      self-collisions occurred, although not as much throughout the cloth in
      comparison to a higher density. The higher density also resulted in larger
      and smoother folds in self-collisions.
    </p>

    <br />
    <br />

    <h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
    <p>
      I implemented diffuse shading, Blinn-Phong shading, texture mapping,
      displacement mapping, bump mapping, and environment-mapped reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaders are isolated programs that run in parallel on GPU. They execute
      sections of the graphics pipeline by taking in an input, such as colour
      parameters or texture files, and outputting a single 4 dimensional vector
      which describes the features at the specified location. In OpenGL there
      are two basic shader types, vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex
      shaders apply transforms to vertices, and can modify the geometric
      properties such as position and normal vectors. This writes the final
      position of the vertex -- I implement how a vertex shader can displace the
      mesh in <code>Displacement.vert</code>. Fragment shaders process the
      fragments produced after rasterisation, taking in the geometric attributes
      of the fragment. It computes and writes a colour out to
      <code>out_color</code>.

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong model combines three components of light to result in the
      final render; ambient, diffuse, and specular. It uses the viewer angle to
      calculate how much light is reflected from the surface and visible to the
      viewer, and also adds a halfway vector in the middle between the light
      source vector and viewer vector. This halfway vector has the potential to
      maximise the reflection intensity.

    <p>
      In bump mapping, the normal vectors of an object are modified in the
      fragment shader to give the illusion of bumps on an object, while in
      displacement mapping the vertex positions are also displaced with a vertex
      shader to reflect the height map. The fragment shader I used for
      displacement mapping is identical to the one I implemented for bump
      mapping. We can see that while the bump mapping maps a texture while
      appears like three dimensional shading, the overall shape of the sphere
      and the cloth at its silhouette and edges is unchanged. On the other hand,
      for displacement mapping, in addition to the appearance of the shadows and
      lights of the textures, the surface geometry of the sphere has been
      changed, as can be seen at the shape's perimeter being un-smooth and
      jagged.

    <p>
      Changing the coarseness, we can see that at a higher coarseness the bump
      shaded sphere actually appears to have a ever so slightly "smoother"
      surface. On the other hand, for the displacement shaded sphere, at
      coarseness 16 it doesn't look too different from the bump-shaded sphere,
      but at a higher coarseness of 128 the change in the sphere's geometry is
      much more pronounced and shows jagged edges on the sphere's silhouette.
