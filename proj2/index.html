    <h2>Task 1</h2>
    <p>
      To rasterize triangles, we want to sample every point inside the triangle.
      To do this, we want to be sure that every point is within the bounds of
      the three lines which comprise the triangle, and then apply the sampling
      function to these points which fulfil this requirement. This often
      involves iterating through points in the frame buffer and testing whether
      they are within these bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our rasterization algorithm, we identify and organise the three points
      of the triangle into leftmost, middle, and rightmost points. We then
      identify the slopes of the three lines of the triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      We sample in two halves -- one loop which samples all points within the
      triangle from the leftmost to the middle point, and then repeating the
      same process in a loop from the middle point to the rightmost point. We
      find an upper bound slope and lower bound slope by comparing the
      leftmost-to-middle slope and the leftmost-to-rightmost slope. From the
      left point, we loop through points within the triangle, sampling from the
      leftmost point to the middle point in vertical lines. We find the starting
      and ending points of the next vertical line by increasing y's lower bound
      and upper bound by the respective slopes of the triangle. Once we reach
      the middle point, we re-identify the upper and lower bound slopes and
      repeat this sampling process for the remaining section of the triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since this algorithm only samples points within the triangle, it is better
      than one which checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.
      Unfortunately we didn't have time to compare this with simple bounding box
      triangle rasterization, since this was the initial approach we directly
      implemented and so couldn't turn "off" our optimization.

    <h2>Task 2</h2>
    <p>
      Supersampling is useful as it samples multiple points inside each pixel to
      reduce the effects of aliasing, which can cause "jaggies" or jagged edges
      on rendered objects. In our supersampling algorithm, we are able to
      antialias the rasterization of our triangle by setting each pixel of the
      frame_buffer to the average color of super-samples inside that pixel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to antialias the triangle by supersampling, we added to our
      rasterize_triangle algorithm from task 1. First, we divided each point
      inside the triangle into multiple smaller pixels based on the given
      sample_rate, by multiplying the x and y coordinates of the triangle's
      vertices by the square root of sample_rate. By doing this, we are
      increasing the resolution of the triangle, enabling us to sample multiple
      points per pixel. Then, as per our original task 1 algorithm, we loop
      through points in the triangle, sampling from the left. To account for
      supersampling in our other functions, we changed set_sample_rate and
      set_framebuffer_target to appropriately resize sample_buffer according to
      the sample_rate. In resolve_to_framebuffer, we looped through the pixels
      and looped through the supersampled points, setting the value of the pixel
      to the average colour of the super samples. The fill_pixel function was
      also modified to consider the rasterization of lines, such as the
      borderline in test 4.

    <h2>Task 3</h2>
    <p>
      We transformed cubeman so that he's looking off into the distance (he
      would be squinting if he had eyes). His head is tilted back slightly
      (rotated), and his left arm is angled (the two parts rotated and
      translated) to place his "hand" on his "hip". His right arm is angled
      upwards (rotated and translated), shielding his eyes (again, if he had
      eyes).

    <h2>Task 4</h2>
    <p>
      Barycentric coordinates are a coordinate system which can be used to
      express any point on a triangle in reference to the scalar values at the
      vertices of the triangle. This allows us to interpolate to obtain smoothly
      varying values across the surface. An example can be seen below in the
      triangle with a red, green, and blue vertex, producing a smoothly blended
      color triangle. Barycentric coordinates allow us to retrieve the color at
      any point in the triangle, which will be a blend of the three colors of
      the three vertices depending on the point's position relative to each
      vertex. Points closer to the blue vertex will contain more of a blue
      "value", and this applies respectively for each vertex.

    <h2>Task 5</h2>
    <p>
      Pixel sampling is used to display textures. It maps the pixels on a screen
      to texture pixels, also known as "texels". We use this technique to
      convert coordinates to the texture space, and map information from the
      texture space to the image. See the figure below for an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearest Pixel Sampling and Bilinear Pixel Sampling are types of methods
      for pixel sampling that we implemented in this assignment. Nearest Pixel
      Sampling consists of finding the closest texel value through rounding the
      specific texture coordinates at a given pixel's location. This method is
      fast, however, it can produce jaggies or unwanted artifacts. Bilinear
      Pixel Sampling uses linear interpolation to identify texels, and
      calculates the average color value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our implementation of sample_nearest involves taking the texture
      coordinates (u,v) of a pixel, and returning the color of the nearest texel
      to that pixel. As such, each pixel is assigned to the color of the texel
      that it is the closest to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our implementation of sample_bilinear involves taking in the texture
      coordinates (u,v) of a pixel, and returning the color of that pixel based
      on the weighted average of the colors around it, specifically of four
      surrounding texels. This method produces a smoother texture as it blends
      colors between neighbouring texels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both functions, sample_nearest and sample_bilinear are called within the
      rasterize_textured_triangle function, which loops through pixels of the
      triangle and calculates the texture coordinates at each pixel using
      barycentric interpolation. Then, we call the respective sampling function
      (nearest or bilinear) to apply the color of the pixel.

    <h2>Task 6</h2>
    <p>
      Level sampling and pixel mapping are both used to perform texture aliasing
      in texture mapping. Level sampling differs in that it samples from
      mipmaps, also known as minified textures, where the highest mipmaps have
      the lowest resolutions of texture, and level zero mipmaps have full
      resolutions. This technique is ideal when a higher resolution texture
      space is attempting to map onto a lower resolution screen space. Level
      sampling decreases the resolution of the texture image to a resolution
      that matches the screen's sampling rate, to avoid having many texels
      involved in one pixel. This way, a desired one to one mapping between the
      texture and screen space can be acheived, eliminating aliasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our algorithm selects the appropriate mipmap by calculating the texture
      coordinates in (u,v) for (x, y), (x+1 y), and (x, y+1). Then, these are
      used to calculate the partial derivatives, with respect to x and y. Taking
      log with base 2 of the max absolute square sum of each partial
      derivatives, will give back the desired mipmap level. We implemented this
      process in the rasterize_textured_triangle, sample, and get_level
      functions. For the options available, we can select nearest level, or
      bilinear, which computes a weighted sum from each adjacent mipmap level
      using interpolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we can adjust our sampling technique by (1) pixel sampling, (2) level
      sampling, and (3) number of samples per pixel. Here are some tradeoffs
      between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the three
      various techniques...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Pixel Sampling: </span>
      Pixel sampling is fast for nearest sampling and slow for bilinear
      sampling. Its memory usage is relatively low since it does not store and
      computational results. In terms of its power, pixel sampling tends to be
      weaker at producing images when textures are minified. The more minified
      or complicated an image is, the more antialiasing tends to exist, which
      can cause problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Level Sampling: </span>
      Level sampling is also fast for nearest sampling and slower for bilinear
      sampling. In terms of speed, it is still faster than supersampling. Its
      memory usage is low, as it also does not store computational results. For
      its power, level sampling is the most efficient at antialiasing when
      texture minification is required or necessary to perform. It is effective
      at mapping textures from higher resolutions texture spaces into a lower
      resolution screen space.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Number of Samples per Pixel (Supersampling):
      </span>
      Finally, supersampling's speed is slow and uses the most memory. Although
      it is a good technique for higher sampling rates, it takes up a ton of
      memory. This is due to needing to save each super sample value, requiring
      lots of computational effort. However, it can be effective at eliminating
      almost all aliasing.
