    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this assignment, I explored various geometric modelling concepts to
      produce a mesh editor. I began by learning how to build Bezier curves
      using the De Casteljau algorithm, learning the basis of how the control
      points correspond with the produce curve and creating a curve editor
      within the program. I was able to reinforce my understanding of how the
      algorithm extends to building Bezier surfaces. Equipped with the ability
      to build surfaces, I then learnt and implemented different methods of
      manipulating the surface "mesh": applying Phong shading through
      area-weighted vertex normals, flipping and splitting edges through pointer
      reassignments, as well as mesh upsampling through loop subdivision.
      Overall, I was able to build a program which could load and manipulate
      three dimensional models.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reflecting on my implementation and process, I appreciated how completing
      these tasks gave me a greater understanding of how to compute the values
      needed for these mesh manipulations. I encountered problems to do with
      float division, pointer reassignment, and incorrectly splitting/flipping
      edges for mesh upsampling. I was able to overcome some of these problems
      by using the debugger in Xcode and setting appropriate breakpoints,
      especially to identify where the program ran into infinite loops or
      discover errors in float division. Some of the other issues I was able to
      resolve through inspection of the output (such as the cube for Part 6) to
      recognise that edges were not being split properly, and focusing my
      debugging efforts on that part of the method.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h2>
    <p>
      I implemented De Casteljau's algorithm to build a Bezier curve given an
      input of control points. De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive method
      used to evaluate Bezier curves. Through repeated linear interpolation, the
      algorithm allows us to find a point which lies on the Bezier curve at a
      given parameter <i>t</i>, where <i>t</i> is between 0 and 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given <i>n</i> control points <i>p<sub>1</sub></i
      >, ..., <i>p<sub>n</sub></i> and the parameter <i>t</i>, De Casteljau's
      algorithm uses linear interpolation to compute <i>n</i> - 1 intermediate
      control points at <i>t</i> in the next subdivision level. These are
      <i>p'<sub>1</sub></i
      >, ..., <i>p'<sub>n-1</sub></i
      >, where <i>p'<sub>i</sub></i> = (1-<i>t</i>) <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> +
      <i>tp<sub>i+1</sub></i
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is applied <i>n</i> - 1 times on the previous subdivision level until
      producing a final singular point which lies on the Bezier curve at
      <i>t</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this part, I implemented one level of the algorithm (one level of
      subdivision) in a function which took in an array of control points and
      returned an array of control points at the next subdivision level. I
      iterated through the argument array and applied the lerp function for
      <i>p'<sub>i</sub></i> described above, before pushing this to an array of
      the new control points.

    <h2>Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h2>
    <p>
      I used the De Casteljau algorithm to build Bezier surfaces given a
      <i>n</i> * <i>n</i> grid of input control points. The De Casteljau
      algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces through the separable 1D De Casteljau
      algorithm. The algorithm described above is applied to a <i>n</i> *
      <i>n</i> grid of original control points, with parameters <i>u</i> and
      <i>v</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each row of <i>n</i> control points defines a Bezier curve parameterised
      by <i>u</i>; the respective final, single point <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> is
      evaluated recursively for each of <i>n</i> rows using the algorithm in
      part 1, with <i>u</i> as the argument <i>t</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <i>n</i> <i>P<sub>i</sub></i
      >'s for each of the <i>n</i> rows then define a Bezier curve with
      parameter <i>v</i>. This is also then evaluated recursively with De
      Casteljau's to produce a final singular point which lies on the Bezier
      surface for given parameters <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h2>
    <p>
      To produce Phong shading as opposed to flat shading, I calculated
      area-weighted normal vertices. I implemented area-weighted normal vectors
      at a vertex by iterating through neighbouring vertices, storing two vertex
      positions <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> at a time, in addition to the original
      vertex position <i>C</i>. Using these three vertices, I found vectors
      <i>C - A</i> and <i>C - B</i>, and used their cross product to calculate
      the normal to the face.
    </p>

    <p>
      I then found the area-weighted normal by dividing this cross product by
      0.5 * its magnitude, and pushed the area-weighted normal to an array of
      all weighted normals. I repeated this process for each face incident to
      the vertex. To find the final vector normal, I summed the weighted normals
      within the array, and divided this summed vector by its own magnitude.

    <h2>Part 4: Edge Flip</h2>
    <p>
      Edge flipping is one method of mesh manipulation which converts a pair of
      triangles into a new pair, with the edge between them rotated (or
      "flipped") in orientation. To implement edge flipping, I initiated
      pointers to every half-edge, face, and vertex. I then reassigned all the
      half-edges' next, twin, vertex, edge, and face pointers according to the
      flipped result -- I kept the vertices and halfedges on the sides of the
      external "diamond" in the same position, but re-assigned the pointer to
      edge (<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) to the vertices <i>a</i> and <i>d</i>. The faces
      (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) and (<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>) then
      became (<i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>) and (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>)
      respectively, and I reassigned the corresponding halfedges based on any
      face changes. I implemented a check at the beginning of the function to
      return if the element is at a boundary.
    </p>

    <img src="./p14.png" width="95%" />

    <p>
      Regarding debugging, my implementation was close to correct on my initial
      attempt. My "debugging" process mostly consisted of re-reading the
      assignments for each mesh element, and then catching and correcting some
      assignments which didn't make sense to me upon the second read.

    <br />
    <br />

    <h2>Part 5: Edge Split</h2>
    <p>
      I implemented edge splitting, another local remeshing operation which
      takes a pair of triangles separated by an edge and inserts a new vertex at
      the centre of the edge, splitting each of the two triangles in half with
      two additional edges (resulting in four triangles). For this part, my
      implementation process was very similar to my implementation of edge
      flips. I initiated pointers to every relevant mesh element (vertices,
      faces, halfedges) and re-assigned all their pointers according to the
      "after split" diagram, including to newly created mesh elements. I created
      the appropriate new halfedges, edges, faces, and vertex, and assigned all
      their pointers. Like Part 4, I "re-purposed" the original edge (<i>b</i>,
      <i>c</i>), this time to become (<i>b</i>, <i>m</i>), and faces (<i>a</i>,
      <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) and (<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>) became (<i>a</i>,
      <i>b</i>, <i>m</i>) and (<i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>m</i>) respectively. For
      the position of <i>m</i>, I added the positions of <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,
      <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>, and then divided this sum by 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      Errors I encountered here were also related to incorrect pointer
      assignments in my original attempt, usually to do with assigning to the
      correct new face and keeping in mind the anti-clockwise direction of the
      half-edges, since I didn't redraw the diagram. I debugged this again
      mostly through carefully re-reading my pointer assignments.

    <h2>Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h2>
    <p>
      I used loop subdivision to process mesh upsampling. To implement loop
      subdivision, I followed the recommended solution of breaking up the method
      into computing new vertex positions for old vertices, computing new vertex
      positions associated with edges, splitting all edges, flipping new edges
      which connected an old and new vertex, and copying in the new vertex
      positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin, I computed new positions for all existing vertices in the input
      mesh using the equation
      <code
        >(1 - n * u) * original_position + u *
        original_neighbor_position_sum</code
      >
      where <i>n</i> is the number of edges incident to the vertex; and
      <i>u</i> is 3/16 if <i>n</i> = 3, or 3 / 8 * <i>n</i> otherwise;
      <i>original_position</i> is the original position of the old vertex, and
      <i>original_neighbor_position_sum</i> is the sum of all original positions
      of the neighboring vertices. I stored these new positions in each existing
      vertex's <code>newPosition</code> pointer, and also set the
      <code>isNew</code> property to false.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, I computed and new vertex positions and stored them in the
      <code>newPosition</code> property for the edges which would split to
      produce these new vertices. The position of a new vertex splitting the
      shared edge (<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>) between a pair of triangles (<i>A</i>,
      <i>C</i>, <i>B</i>) and (<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>D</i>) is
      <code>3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)</code>. I also set these existing
      edges' <code>isNew</code> property to be false.
    </p>

    <p>
      To split the appropriate edges, I split the edges which had no new
      vertices, and set the resultant vertex to be new along with assigning it
      its pre-computed new position. I also set the newly created edges to be
      true for <code>isNew</code>, to assist in flipping the correct edges.
    </p>

    <p>
      I then iterated again over all edges and flipped edges if they were new
      and had exactly one new vertex. Finally, I reassigned all old vertices to
      have their new position.

        </figcaption>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      I noticed that after loop subdivision, the sharp corners and edges on
      meshes become more rounded, "curving" even if they were original straight
      lines. This is because they are pulled closer in towards the neighbouring
      vertices in position when upsampling -- for example, for a corner of the
      cube which directly protrudes towards a certain direction, every
      neighbouring vertex (other corners of the cube) is further away from that
      direction. Therefore, by weighting neighbouring vertices in the
      computation of this vertex's new position, it moves slightly away from the
      direction it pointed in and "rounds" out.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also saw that after a few iterations of subdivision on the cube model,
      the mesh becomes slightly asymmetrical after repeated subdivisions. This
      is because the original mesh is asymmetrical, despite the symmetrical cube
      surface produced. Since each face of the cube is split diagonally but
      asymmetrically, some cube vertices have five neighbouring vertices, while
      some have four. This difference factors into the calculation of new vertex
      positions, leading to asymmetry in the new vertices and an overall
      asymmetry to the shape.
    </p>

    <p>
      To subdivide the cube symmetrically, I pre-processed by splitting the edge
      of the mesh which cuts across each face of the cube so that the mesh for
      the cube was also symmetrical. This meant all the vertices had the same
      number of neighbouring vertices, and so the new vertex position
      calculations were relatively the same, producing a "perfect" rounded cube.

    </div>
    <p>
      I reduced the effect of the rounded corners by splitting the edges of the
      cube (first across each face to be symmetrical, then at each edge of the
      cube) so that the vertices original protrude more, mitigating the rounding
      effect when the vertex is "pulled back" by its neighbouring vertices for
      its new position.
