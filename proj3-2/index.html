    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this assignment, I implemented mirror and glass materials as well as
      depth of field to apply my respective understandings of reflection and
      refraction and simulating a thin lens. For mirror and glass materials, I
      added the transformation for reflection, implemented mirror material,
      produced refractive elements using Snell's law, and applied Schlick's
      approximation for glas material. I uniformly sampled the disk representing
      the thin lens and calculated a new ray which originates from the lens and
      intersects with the plane of focus to create a depth of field effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reflecting on my implementation and process, I faced some minor problems
      implementing the glass material BSDF with some slip-ups in writing the
      code for our <code>sample_f()</code> routine, but fixed this through
      carefully looking at my implementation line-by-line and comparing to the
      routine specified in the project docs. I also initially made mistakes when
      calculating the intersection of the plane of focus and ray produced from
      the pinhole camera, but was able to correct this through looking closely
      at the calculation for plane-line intersection on Wikipedia.
    </p>

    <h2>Part A: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>
    <p>
      To achieve rendering scenes with mirror and glass materials, I implemented
      reflection with a simple transformation which takes advantage of the
      object coordinate space which the BSDF calculations occur in. Because the
      <i>z</i> axis lies along the normal vector, a reflection transforms the
      <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates to be negative. To add mirror material,
      we reflect the outgoing light direction and store this in the incident
      light direction. We return
      <code>reflectance / abs_cos_theta(*wi)</code> to cancel out the cosine
      that that <code>at_least_one_bounce_radiance()</code> will multiply by
      because perfect mirrors only change the ray direction but don't cause
      Lambertian falloff. I implemented refraction using Snell's law, checking
      that the light refracts when it does not experience total internal
      reflection. The coordinates for the resultant refracted ray are
      <code>ω<sub>i</sub>.x=−ηω<sub>o</sub>.x</code>,
      <code>ω<sub>i</sub>.y=−ηω<sub>o</sub>.y</code>, and
      <code
        >ω<sub>i</sub>.z=∓sqrt(1-η<super>2</super>(1-ω<sub>o</sub>.z<super>2</super>))</code
      >. For glass material, I used Schlick's approximation to model the ratio
      of the reflection energy to refraction energy. Because the sample function
      for glass material can only return one ray direction, we use this
      approximation as a coin-flip probability of either reflecting or
      refracting.

    <p>
      The images above show the scene <code>CBspheres.dae</code> rendered with
      <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 0, we cannot see the spheres, or
      anything that isn't a light at zero bounces. This is because we only
      return objects directly emitting light towards the camera.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 1, we have one bounce, which only
      includes objects which are directly illuminated. The spheres are black
      with a reflection of the ceiling light, because at one bounce the light
      hits the surface of the spheres and reflects to the cameras. It can be
      noted that the right sphere is also refractive, so some rays enter the
      sphere; the reflected light patch on the right sphere is more "spotty",
      while the reflected light patch on the left sphere is "complete" with no
      absorbed rays.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 2, we can notice that for the left
      reflective sphere, the mirror material can reflect with two light bounces.
      The ceiling is now no longer black after receiving reflected light rays.
      In the reflective sphere, the ceiling's reflection is still black as it
      reflects the ceiling's appearance "from the previous bounce" and requires
      another light bounce for the coloured ceiling to appear. For the
      refractive sphere, it is still dark as another bounce is required for the
      light from the back wall to go through the sphere, but we can see some of
      the reflected light rays.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 3, we can see that the reflective
      left sphere is now reflecting the coloured ceiling with another bounce. In
      the left (mirror) sphere's reflection, we can see that the right sphere is
      still dark -- another bounce is required for the light from this right
      sphere to be reflected from the left. There is a light beneath the sphere
      on the right, resulting from light from the ceiling bouncing to the top of
      the sphere, then into the bottom surface of the sphere, and then to the
      floor of the box before reaching the camera.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 4, we can see that there is also a
      reflection in the right sphere of the light on the ground, resulting in a
      "glow" effect at the bottom of the sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 5, there are not noticeable new
      effects in the scene, but with another bounce, we can see that the shadows
      in the scene are lighter.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 100, we can see that with up to 100
      bounces, the scene is slightly lighter with more reflected light with each
      bounce. However, since the amount of light reflected at each bounce
      diminishes, the difference is still rather marginal.
    </p>

    <br />
    <br />

    <h2>Part B: Depth of Field</h2>
    <p>
      The difference between a pinhole and lens camera is that in a pinhole
      model, the image is always focused, while with a lens the image is brought
      to focus by adjusting the lens position. Since a pinhole camera has such a
      small opening, incidental light arrives from a singular direction and
      source; the intensity of light entering is fixed. Meanwhile in a lens
      camera the intensity of light entering is controlled by the size of the
      lens aperture. This is what allows a lens camera to focus at one distance
      and blur the foreground and background, producing depth of field.
    </p>
    <p>
      To produce depth of field, I implemented generating rays for a thin lens.
      To do this, I uniformly sampled the thin lens to represent the point on
      the lens where the "film" receives radiance. I then calculated the ray
      which originates from this point and set its direction towards the point
      in focus.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      We can see that in the pictures above, a smaller focal distance means a
      focal point closer to the camera. This is especially obvious when
      inspecting the straight lines of the lights and the ceiling, and seeing
      the segments which are more in focus, while the foreground and background
      are blurred. By increasing the focal distance, the focused segment
      "travels" further back in the scene.

    </div>

    <p>
      In the screenshots above, we can see that as lens radius increases, there
      is an increase in blur in the picture. We can see that while the focal
      distance remains constant, the image at different planes of focus seems to
      become blurrier. This is because as lens radius increases, more light is
      let into the scene from different directions, and only the rays which
      match closely with the focus point are collimated and sharp.
